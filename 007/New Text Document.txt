After nearly two decades of gradual decline, the global music industry has increased for the eighth year in a row. Surprisingly, the switch to online distribution has simultaneously expedited and hasten the downfall of the music business. Following the golden period of the CD, the arrival of MP3 and file sharing rocked the music industry like an earthquake, propelling worldwide music sales to previously unheard-of heights during the 1990s Physical sales of music fell by about 60% from 2001 to 2010, costing $14 billion in income annually. The increase in digital music revenues from nothing to over $4 billion over the same length of time was insufficient to even cover the decline in CD sales. The music sectors profits didn't start to improve again until the emergence and broad use of music streaming services. The music sector peaked in 2014, when revenue hit a twenty-year record of $13.1 billion, $9 billion fewer than it stood at 15 years previously, throughout the prime during the CD period, and physical music retail sales alone reached $22.3 billion. This information is based on data released by IFPI. The music business was first reluctant to welcome streaming services, but record companies and musicians now seem to have embraced the public's example and accepted that digital distribution is where music is headed. Most global music sales last year came from digital music, with streaming platforms solely contributing 67% of the entire income made by the sector. [3], [4]
